# Mighty code test (poll app)

## backend

---
- code located in /back-end (believe it or not!)
- opted to do the extra credit of using file storage as a mock db
  right away because trying to deal with fake data and 
  constantly losing it in local storage sucks

spin up :

``cd [path to project]/back-end``

``node index.js``

## frontend

---
- code located in... take a guess... /front-end!
- boilerplate genned with next.js cli
- used a slightly older tailwind version than current because I was stuck in config hell 
  for the newer version and wanted to actually start writing front end code

spin up :

``cd [path to project]/front-end``

``npm install``

``npm run dev``
